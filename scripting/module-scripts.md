# Module Scripts

Module Scripts allows you to add more complex and specific handling of values, help parsing data from network or serial streams that are following a specific API. 

It's also the way to create [Custom Modules](../modules/custom-modules/), where you can define your own values and parameters, and have scripts run the main logic.
