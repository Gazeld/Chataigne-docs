# Reaper

Reaper is a music software, or DAW made by [Cockos](https://www.cockos.com/index.php). You can find more about it [here](https://www.reaper.fm/).

The Reaper module is based on the OSC module, with premade commands that reflect [Reaper's OSC API.](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/osc/osc.php#osc_pattern_config)

{% hint style="info" %}
The Reaper Module has very limited premade command support, but you can create your own commands by using the "_Custom Message_" command. If you wish to have more native support, please contact me and consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/benkuper) so I can take more time improving Chataigne !
