# PowerPoint

This allows to control Powerpoint slides and get informations on the current slide.

This module is based on the OSC module, with premade commands and values that reflect the [Powerpoint-OSC API](https://github.com/benkuper/PowerPoint-OSC). You will need to install this plugin in order to use the module.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This module is currently only supported on Windows as it relies on a Windows-only OSC plugin.
