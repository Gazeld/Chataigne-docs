# QLab

QLab is a video/sound/lighting show control software made by [Figure53](https://figure53.com). You can find more about it [here](https://qlab.app).

The QLab module is based on the OSC module, with premade commands that reflect [QLab's OSC API.](https://qlab.app/docs/v4/scripting/osc-dictionary-v4/)
