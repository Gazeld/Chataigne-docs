# Kinect V2

The KinectV2 module allows you to get skeletal data for the first detected user in front of the Kinect.

This module is a quick way to get simple informations about the detected skeletons. It may evolve in a more customizable module depending on the community's response to it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This module only works on Windows.

Due to end of production of the KinectV2, there are very few chances that this module will be supported on MacOS and Linux. If you wish to add support for the KinectV2 on Mac or Linux, contact me and please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/benkuper) so I can spend more time on Chataigne !
