# JoyCon

The Joycon module currently only works on Windows.

After having connected your joycons via the windows bluetooth interface, you will be able to get all the sensor data from your left and right controllers here.

Due to bugs in Windows's bluetooth stack, when rebooting you computer or your controllers, you will probably have to remove the device from the bluetooth settings and add it again, then restart Chataigne.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This module is supposed to work on MacOS and Linux as well, but you may experiences crashes. If you wish to improve support for JoyCon, contact me and please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/benkuper) so I can spend more time on Chataigne !
