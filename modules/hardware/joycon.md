# JoyCon

The Joycon module currently only works on Windows.

After having connected your joycons via the windows bluetooth interface, you will be able to get all the sensor data from your left and right controllers here.

Due to bugs in Windows's bluetooth stack, when rebooting you computer or your controllers, you will probably have to remove the device from the bluetooth settings and add it again, then restart Chataigne.
