# Stream Deck

The Stream Deck Module allows to connect to Elgato's Stream Deck devices.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, only Elgato Stream Deck classic 1st gen is supported. More support will be added future versions. If you wish to improve support on Stream Deck, contact me and please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/benkuper) so I can spend more time on Chataigne !
