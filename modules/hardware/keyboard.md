# Keyboard

{% hint style="danger" %}
The output for this module only works on Windows !
{% endhint %}

The keyboard module will log your input keys and let you use the last key hit and the special keys combinations as well.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Special keys are only detected when hitting a "normal" key. You can't just detect a shift key or control key pressed right now.
{% endhint %}
