# Sound Card

The Sound Card module will allow you to have basic volume and pitch detection from the first channel of your sound card.

Also, if you're using an audio layer in your sequences, you will need a Sound Card module to output the sound as there is no global audio settings.

You can connect to multiple sound cards in the same project.
