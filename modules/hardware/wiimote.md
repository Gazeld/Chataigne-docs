# Wiimote

After having connected your wiimote via the windows bluetooth interface, you will be able to get all the sensor data from your controller here.

Due to bugs in Windows's bluetooth stack, when rebooting you computer or your controllers, you will probably have to remove the device from the bluetooth settings and add it again, then restart Chataigne.
