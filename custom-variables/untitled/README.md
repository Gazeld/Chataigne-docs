# Introduction to Custom Variables

Custom Variables are the place to store, modify and retrieve custom data in Chataigne.

When creating an interactive project or a show, sometimes you want to keep track of different values and uses them later or for different purposes. Then you can create your own group of values and presets, and make them evolve as your project runs on, or simple store nice presets of multiple values at once.

Custom Variables are structured intro Groups, so it's easy to organize different groups of custom variables and then you can have different presets for different groups.

This concept is a bit abstract for non-programmers, so check out the example to get a better idea of how it could help you in your projects.
