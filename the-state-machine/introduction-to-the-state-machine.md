# Introduction to the State Machine

The State machine will let you create your own interaction rules to do realtime control of all your system. As the name says, it's a state machine, which means you can create different states, each one being a group of rules that you can activate or deactivate as you wish. You can also create transitions between them, allowing for creating evolving interactions.

When creating an interaction, you will first have to create a state that will contains the rules.

## States

States are containers that will contains different interaction rules. They can be activated and deactivate manually or automatically, and you can create transition between them.

Currently, you can 2 type of rules : [**Actions**](actions.md) **and** [**Mappings**](mappings.md)**.**  
  
When creating an interaction, you will want either punctual control to trigger commands : these are [**Actions**](actions.md)**,** or continuous control to link input values to parameters : those are [**Mappings**](mappings.md)**.**
