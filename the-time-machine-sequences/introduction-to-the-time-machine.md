# Introduction to the Time Machine

## The Time Machine

The Time Machine will let you create timeline-based sequences and create triggers and parameter animations over time.

You can create as many sequences as you want from the Sequence panel, and control them independently.

### Sequence

A sequence is time-based object that has its own timeline and contains a group of layers.

### Layer

A layer is one line of a timeline, containing data that is read through time. It can be of multiple types :

* [Triggers](trigger-layer.md)
* [Mapping](../the-state-machine/mappings.md)
* [Color](color-layer.md)
* [Audio](audio-layer.md)
