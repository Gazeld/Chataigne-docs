# Trigger Layer

A trigger layer contains triggers that are like actions but they will be triggered at the time they're set. You can still have custom conditions to forbid this trigger to actually do anything if your conditions are not validated at the time the trigger is supposed to launch. Those trigger will get more featured in the future versions.
