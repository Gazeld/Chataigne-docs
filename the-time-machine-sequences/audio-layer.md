# Audio Layer

The audio layer lets you add multiple audio clips that will be played in time. The support for that is limited but let's you have a basic audio track while animating and working. When you add an audio layer, be sure to have a sound card module as well, so the sequence can connect to a sound card and actually play the sound.
