# Mapping 2D Layer

Mapping 2D layers allow you to animate a point along a 2D path. You can create separately the 2D path and then animate the position on it in the timeline.

Like the standard Mapping Layer, you can use the recorder to record a 2D input value, and you can also draw your curve by hand using **Ctrl + shift + drag.**
