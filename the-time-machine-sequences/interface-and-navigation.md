# Interface and navigation

### Cues

Cues are marks that you can add on the timeline, and then use to play from there, or go to the next cue, etc. 

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also choose to pause the timeline when it hits a cue, which can be convenient when doing semi-interactive shows \(waiting for an actor to finish a line, or a dancer to come on stage before continuing\)
{% endhint %}

### Zooming and scrolling

By clicking and dragging up/down and left/right the blue rectangle on top of the sequence's timeline, you will be able to navigate and zoom.
