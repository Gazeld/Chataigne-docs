# Mapping Layer

A Mapping layer contains an automation, which is a curve based animation. This is curve is then used as an input for a mapping. You can then use this layer that like a state mapping and add filters and outputs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since version 1.7.0, you can draw a curve by holding **Ctrl+Shift** and dragging your mouse from left to right in the timeline of the Mapping layer. Your drawing will then be automatically converted into an editable automation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Since version 1.7.0, you can choose the range of your automation from the "**Range**" parameter in the panel. You can also make it free range by disabling this parameter. You will then be able to scroll in the layer by using **Alt**  \(and **Alt+Shift** for zooming**\)** and dragging the mouse vertically.
